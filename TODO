Items outstanding:

 * Add file to .gitignore or info/excludes.

 * Allow user to define keyboard shortcuts for frequently used fetch
   or merge operations.  Or maybe just define a keyboard shortcut
   for default fetch/default merge of current branch is enough;
   but I do know a few users who merge a couple of common branches
   also into the same branch so one default isn't quite enough.

 * Better organize fetch/push/pull console windows.

 * Clone UI (to download a new repository).

 * Remotes editor (for .git/config format only).

 * Show a shortlog of the last couple of commits in the main window,
   to give the user warm fuzzy feelings that we have their data
   saved.  Actually this may be the set of commits not yet in
   the upstream (aka default merge branch remote repository).

 * GUI configuration editor for options listed in
   git.git/Documentation/config.txt.  Ideally this would
   parse that file and generate the options dialog from
   the documentation itself, and include the help text
   from the documentation as part of the UI somehow.

Known bugs:

 * git-gui sometimes just closes on Windows with no error message.
   I'm not sure what the problem is here.  I suspect the wish
   process is just terminating due to a segfault or something,
   as the do_quit proc in git-gui doesn't run.  It often seems to
   occur while writing a commit message in the buffer.  Odd.
