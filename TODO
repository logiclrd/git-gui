Items outstanding:

 * Add file to .gitignore or info/excludes.

 * Allow user to define keyboard shortcuts for frequently used fetch
   or merge operations.  Or maybe just define a keyboard shortcut
   for default fetch/default merge of current branch is enough;
   but I do know a few users who merge a couple of common branches
   also into the same branch so one default isn't quite enough.

 * Better organize fetch/push/pull console windows.

 * Clone UI (to download a new repository).

 * Remotes editor (for .git/config format only).

 * Show a shortlog of the last couple of commits in the main window,
   to give the user warm fuzzy feelings that we have their data
   saved.  Actually this may be the set of commits not yet in the
   upstream (aka default merge branch remote repository).

 * GUI configuration editor for options listed in
   git.git/Documentation/config.txt.  Ideally this would parse
   that file and generate the options dialog from the documentation
   itself, and include the help text from the documentation as part
   of the UI somehow.

 * Allow user to view unreachable objects in verify database.
   (laj - on #git).

 * Allow user to recover an unreachable object in verify database.
   (laj - on #git).

 * Clicking on file list header in main window shows entire patch,
   for all files.

 * Move/save our settings to ~/.gitgui-config and .git/gitgui-config,
   not to the master user/repository configuration files.

 * Better browser icons/interface.

 * Blame window doesn't save/restore geometry.  Alex Resien would
   like it do so, or at least have a more reasonable default one.

Known bugs:

 * Geometry restore on resized virtual desktop is horrible; e.g.
   if I have git-gui on my external monitor and then disconnect the
   monitor and later restart git-gui, it opens in an unreachable
   part of my desktop. gitk has the same wart.

 * I've seen a question mark icon in the browser before in one
   of my work repos.  I'm not sure why it had a question mark
   icon.  It also had no name, and couldn't be opened in the
   blame viewer.

 * git-gui sometimes just closes on Windows with no error message.
   I'm not sure what the problem is here.  I suspect the wish
   process is just terminating due to a segfault or something,
   as the do_quit proc in git-gui doesn't run.  It often seems to
   occur while writing a commit message in the buffer.  Odd.
