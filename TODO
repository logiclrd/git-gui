Items outstanding:

 * Add file to .gitignore or info/excludes.

 * Better organize fetch/push/pull console windows.

 * Clone UI (to download a new repository).

 * Remotes editor (for .git/config format only).

 * Show a shortlog of the last couple of commits in the main window,
   to give the user warm fuzzy feelings that we have their data
   saved.  Actually this may be the set of commits not yet in the
   upstream (aka default merge branch remote repository).

 * GUI configuration editor for options listed in
   git.git/Documentation/config.txt.  Ideally this would parse
   that file and generate the options dialog from the documentation
   itself, and include the help text from the documentation as part
   of the UI somehow.

 * Allow user to view unreachable objects in verify database.
   (laj - on #git).

 * Allow user to recover an unreachable object in verify database.
   (laj - on #git).

 * Clicking on file list header in main window shows entire patch,
   for all files.

 * Move/save our settings to ~/.gitgui-config and .git/gitgui-config,
   not to the master user/repository configuration files.

Known bugs:

 * Geometry restore on resized virtual desktop is horrible; e.g.
   if I have git-gui on my external monitor and then disconnect the
   monitor and later restart git-gui, it opens in an unreachable
   part of my desktop. gitk has the same wart.
